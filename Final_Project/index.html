		<h4>Color Contrast</h4>
		<p class="one">There was a sufficient amount of color contrast lacking in the text on the flyout menu in the upper right corner and on the '+' icons that inform about the expanding menus:
		</p>
		<div class="examples menu">
		<img class="menu" src="./images/menu.png" alt="Flyout Menu">
		<img class="icon" src="./images/icons.png" alt="Icon">
		</div>
		<p class="two">The colors used are so faint that is very easy to miss these visual indicators on the screen. Increasing the color contrast would help those who suffer from visual imparements to better recognize these signifiers that let them operate the site. Additionally, it would help to enhance the visual design, giving a greater sense of balance and cohesion.
		</p>
		<h4>Tab &amp; Focus</h4>
		<p class="three"> A big issue on this site was that users cannot tab through the main content if any of the expandable menus are closed. Additionally, if the menus are open, tabbing only takes the user to content with embedded links.</p>
		<p class="four"> I highly recommend implementing more detailed tab-index functionality within the html code that will allow users to navigate to important content that can be read by screen readers. This would include denoting the html main content with the proper tag elements that could be tabbed to automatically, or alternatively the tab index could be hard coded into each element.</p>
		<p class="five">The designer could go an extra mile to further increase accessibility by implementing the pseudo class :focus in order to bring additional attention to tabbed items. For example, the items in focus could be gently highlighted with a faint/transparent red color. This would create enough color and grayscale contrast to draw attention to the element while simultaneously remaining unabraisive to the eye and unhindering to the overall design.</p>
