		<h4>Color Contrast</h4>
		<p class="one">There was a sufficient amount of color contrast lacking in the text on the flyout menu in the upper right corner and on the '+' icons that inform about the expanding menus:
		</p>
		<div class="examples menu">
		<img class="menu" src="./images/menu.png" alt="Flyout Menu">
		<img class="icon" src="./images/icons.png" alt="Icon">
		</div>
		<p class="two">The colors used are so faint that is very easy to miss these visual indicators on the screen. Increasing the color contrast would help those who suffer from visual imparements to better recognize these signifiers that let them operate the site. Additionally, it would help to enhance the visual design, giving a greater sense of balance and cohesion.
		</p>
		<h4>Tab &amp; Focus</h4>
		<p class="three"> A big issue on this site was that users cannot tab through the main content if any of the expandable menus are closed. As it is currently designed, users with limited mobility are not able to access the main content by the use of their keyboard.</p>
		<p class="four"> I highly recommend implementing more detailed tab-index functionality within the html code that will allow users to navigate to the main content. More specifically, there should be a tab function that would allow users to access the collapsable menus and expand them.</p>
		<p class="five">The designer could go an extra mile to further increase accessibility by implementing the pseudo class :focus in order to bring additional attention to tabbed items. For example, the items in focus could be gently highlighted with a faint/transparent red color. This would create enough color and grayscale contrast to draw attention to the element while simultaneously remaining unabraisive to the eye and causing minimal disturbance to the overall visual design.</p>
